# Agent Workflows

> Operational namespace for Jamie's Pixoid crew workflows: route governance, durable context, agent entrypoints, verification gates, and markdown-first agent memory.

## Scope

### Covers

Pixoid/Tinker/Quill/Boba operating model, Hermes Mission Control, route governance, memory boundaries, context handoffs, Knowledge Pack Routing, agent entrypoint meshes, static retrieval/eval gates, self-improving agent systems, and workflow reliability practices.

### Not Covered

Product case studies except where they demonstrate agent workflow mechanics; low-level local AI infrastructure unless it affects workflow execution; public wiki publishing mechanics except where they define agent routing contracts; Daily Notes scratch chronology unless explicitly promoted into durable source notes.

### Current As

2026-06-24 — Creative Ideation Routing added to the agent skill-routing layer; open-ended inspiration now routes through `creative-ideation` before returning to product/build gates.

## Routing Rules

- Primary namespace: `agent-workflows` for crew operating model, KPR, entrypoint meshes, and route/eval workflow practices.
- Also relevant to `pixi-vault` when namespace compiler or publishing boundaries change.
- Also relevant to `eval-trace` when workflow quality, route failure modes, or static eval gates are being evaluated.
- Use primary namespace plus crosslinks. Do not duplicate pages across namespaces unless the page is rewritten for a different user job.

## Public Output Contract

When published to `pixi-wiki`, this namespace should expose:

```text
/raw/agent-workflows/README.md
/raw/agent-workflows/wiki/index.md
/wiki/agent-workflows/README.md.html
/wiki/agent-workflows/wiki/index.md.html
```

## Maintenance

- Edit canonical source notes first.
- Use `Wiki Compiler Maps/Namespace Wiki Compiler Map.md` for routing decisions.
- Do not compile Daily Notes directly unless promoted or verified.
- Update `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md` whenever compiled pages are added.
