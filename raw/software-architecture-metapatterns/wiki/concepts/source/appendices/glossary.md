# Glossary

> Imported source page from Denys Poltorak's *Architectural Metapatterns* wiki. Source path: `Appendices/Glossary.md`.

*Abstractness* – the scope of information that a *concept* operates\. Highly abstract *concepts* describe the *system’s* behavior in less words\.

*Action* – an act of a *system* that changes its environment\.

[[wiki/concepts/source/basic-metapatterns/layers|*API*]] \(*application programming interface*\) – a set of *methods* or *messages* that a *component* exposes to its *clients*\.

[[wiki/concepts/source/basic-metapatterns/layers|*Application*]] – the most *abstract* layer that usually *integrates components* of a less *abstract* layer\.

*Architectural pattern* – a way to structure a *system* or a part of a *system* to achieve desirable properties \(address a set of *forces*\)\.

*Architectural style* – see *architecture*\.

*Architecture* – the structure \(*components* and their *interactions*\) of a system which follows a certain framework or guidelines\.

*ASS diagram* – a *structural diagram* with *abstraction*, *subdomain* and *sharding* for coordinates\.

*Asynchronous communication* – the mode of *communication* when the sender of the *request message* does not stop the execution of its *scenario* to wait for the confirmation message\.

*Attack surface* – the amount of *components* and functionality that faces an external network \(potentially exposed to hackers\)\.

*Availability* – the percentage of time that the *system* is operational \(satisfies its *users*\)\.

*Bounded context* – a subset of *requirements* and code that shares a set of *concepts*\. Usually consists of internals of a *component* and *APIs* of all the *components* it uses\.

*Business logic* – the thing that *users* pay for\. It is the heart of the business and is usually the largest part of the *project*\. You cannot buy *business logic*, only *implement* it\. *Business logic* comprises *use cases* and *business rules*\.

*Business rules* – *domain concepts* and their relations\. They make the low\-level half of *business logic*\.

*Choreography* – a kind of *workflow* in which *components* that belong to the same level of *abstractness* cooperate to implement a *use case*\.

*Client* – an external *component* or *system* that makes use of a *component* or *system* in question\.

*Colocated* – running in the same address space \(process\) on the same hardware\.

*Communication* – transfer of data or signals in a *system*\.

*Complexity* – the cognitive load caused by the quantity of entities \(*concepts* or *modules*\) and their relations that a programmer needs to operate\.

*Component* – an encapsulated part of a *system*\. It exposes an *API* to the system's *clients* and/or other *components* of the *system*\.

*Concept* – a notion of an element of a *system's* behavior, usually present in *requirements*\.

*Contract* – the informal rules for the behavior of a *component* expected by its *clients*\.

*Control* – a kind of system that supervises physical entities or external programs\.

[[wiki/concepts/source/basic-metapatterns/layers|*Domain*]] – the middle layer of a *system* that contains its *business rules*\.

*Event* – a signal that carries some meaning for a *system* or *component*\. *Events* may carry data\.

*Fault tolerance* – the ability of a *system* to remain \(at least partially\) operational if one or more of its *components* fail \(become inaccessible due to a hang, crash or a hardware failure\)\.

*Forces* – restrictions on the design and development of a system based on the *qualities* it should meet \(see *non\-functional requirements*\) and organizational limitations \(such as time, budget and skills\)\.

*Functional requirements* – the *requirements* that describe *inputs* and *outputs* of a *system*, but not its *performance* or stability\.

*Global use case* – a *use case* that involves most of the *components* of a *system*\. Such *scenarios* are strongly affected by the *system’s* structure\.

*Implementation* – the process of writing code\.

*Implementation* – internals of a *component*\.

*Infrastructure* – the lowest layer of a *system* that provides general\-purpose functionality \(tools\) to its upper layers\.

*Input* – *events* or data that a *system* reacts to\.

*Integration* – see *orchestration*\.

*Integration complexity* – the *complexity* of understanding how individual *components interact* to make a *system*\.

*Interactions* – the kinds and routes of *communication* between *components* of a *system*\.

*Interface* – see *API*\.

*Latency* – the delay between a *system’s* receiving *input* and producing a corresponding *output*\.

*Layers* – *components* of a *system* partitioned by the level of *abstraction*\.

*Messaging* – communication by sending short pieces of data\.

*Method call* – invocation of an *interface* method \(or procedure\) of a *component* by another *component*\.

*Metapattern* – a cluster of *patterns* that have similar *topologies* and address related issues\.

*Module* – a *colocated* \(in\-process\) *component*\.

*Non\-functional requirements* \(*NFR*s\) – expected properties of a *system* \(such as its stability or response time\) which are crucial for the *system* to be built, *deployed*, and used successfully\. Closely related to *qualities* and *forces*\.

*Notification* – an *event* that one *component* sends to another *component*\(s\) to inform them of some change\.

*Operational complexity* – see *integration complexity*\.

*Orchestration* – a kind of *workflow* where a single dedicated *component* \(*Orchestrator*\) makes use of \(usually multiple\) less *abstract components*\. *Facade* \[[wiki/concepts/source/appendices/books-referenced|[GoF]]\] is a good example\.

*Output* – *actions* or data that a *system* produces\.

*Pattern* – a documented approach \(blueprint\) for solving a recurrent programming issue\.

*Project* – the process of making a *system*\.

*Pub/sub \(publish/subscribe\)* – a mode of *communication* when one *component* \(*subscriber*\) receives a subset of *notifications* from another *component* \(*publisher*\)\. It is the *subscriber* that chooses which *notifications* it is interested in\.

*Qualities* – the properties which a *component* or \(sub\)*system* manifests to satisfy *forces*\.

*Real\-time* – a *force* that requires the *system* to respond to incoming *events* immediately\.

*Request/confirmation* – a pair of *messages* between two *components* \(Requestor and Executor\)\. The *request* describes an *action* that the requestor wants the executor to run \(R =\> E\)\. The *confirmation* describes the results of the execution \(R \<= E\)\.

*Requirements* – a set of rules that describe the correct \(expected\) behavior of the *system*\.

*Resources* – CPU, memory, network bandwidth and other stuff that costs money\.

*Scaling* – ability to increase *throughput* of a system by providing it with more *resources*\.

*Services* – *components* of a *system* partitioned by *subdomain*\.

*Sharding* – deploying multiple instances of a *component*\.

*Single point of failure* – a software or hardware *component* which if fails makes the entire *system* non\-operational\. High\-*availability systems* should avoid *single points of failure*\.

*Subdomain* – a distinct *cohesive* part of *domain* knowledge\.

*Synchronous communication* – the mode of communication when the *requesting component* waits for results of its *request* to another *component* before continuing to run its *task*\.

*System* – a self\-sufficient set of *communicating components* that were brought together or *implemented* to satisfy its *users* \(by running *use cases*\)\.

*Task* – a high\-level sequence of execution steps\. Similar to *use case* or *scenario*\.

*Team* – a few programmers and testers that work on a *component*\. Teams of more than 5 members lose productivity to communication overhead\.

*Testing* – checking how satisfactorily the *system* behaves\.

*Throughput* – the amount of data a *system* can *process* per unit of time\.

*Topology* – A map of system components and their relations, similar to a *structural diagram*\.
